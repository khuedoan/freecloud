## Get started

### Prerequisites

- Fork this repository because you will need to customize it for your needs.
- A credit/debit card to register for the accounts.
- Basic knowledge on Terraform, Ansible and Kubernetes (optional, but will help a lot)

Configuration files:

<details>

<summary>Terraform Cloud</summary>

- Create a Terraform Cloud account at <https://app.terraform.io>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Oracle Cloud</summary>

- Create an Oracle Cloud account at <https://cloud.oracle.com>
- Generate an API signing key:
  - Profile menu (User menu icon) -> User Settings -> API Keys -> Add API Key
  - Select Generate API Key Pair, download the private key to `~/.oci/private.pem` and click Add
  - Copy the Configuration File Preview to `~/.oci/config` and change `key_file` to `~/.oci/private.pem`

If you see a warning like this, try to avoid those regions:

> ⚠️ Because of high demand for Arm Ampere A1 Compute capacity in the Foo and Bar regions, A1 instance availability in these regions is limited.
> If you plan to create A1 instances, we recommend choosing another region as your home region

</details>

Remember to backup the following credential files (you can put them in a password manager):

- `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json`

Install the following packages:

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html)

That's it! Run the following command to open the Nix shell:
